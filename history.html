            <h2>The Beginning of KCDC</h2>
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>
                    In 2008, Fr. Justin Zigiranyirazo and his wife Philomene began their journey of faith and service to the people of Rwanda. 
                    After witnessing the dire conditions of street children in the town of Karongi, they were moved to act. They began reaching out 
                    to those who had been abandoned, offering them the opportunity for a better future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From that moment on, their mission was clear: to provide vocational training, spiritual guidance, and a sense of hope to the 
                    people who had none. With just a handful of volunteers and resources, they began to transform lives, one person at a time.

        <section class="growth">
            <h2>Our Growth</h2>
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>
                    What started as a small initiative soon grew into a life-changing movement for many in Rwanda. By 2015, KCDC had expanded 
                    its outreach, bringing in more volunteers, training programs, and, most importantly, more hope. The success stories of young 
                    people who had transformed their lives through vocational training were spreading across the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With new partnerships and the support of local and international donors, KCDC continued to expand, reaching more remote 
                    areas and offering life-changing opportunities to those who needed it most.

            <h2>The Impact We've Made</h2>
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>
                    Today, KCDC has trained thousands of individuals, from young mothers to street children, in skills like tailoring, 
                    farming, mechanics, and hairdressing. The holistic approach of combining vocational training with spiritual mentorship 
                    has given individuals the tools to overcome adversity and build sustainable futures for themselves and their families.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ripple effect is profound. Many of KCDC's graduates have returned to their communities as leaders, sharing their skills, 
                    wisdom, and hope with others. Through mentorship programs, community outreach, and local partnerships, KCDC is ensuring 
                    that the cycle of empowerment continues for generations to come.

            <h2>Our Vision for the Future</h2>
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>
                    The journey of KCDC is far from over. Our vision for the future is to build a state-of-the-art training center in Musanze, 
                    Northern Rwanda, where we will continue to equip the next generation with the tools, skills, and faith to transform their lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With an unwavering commitment to sustainability, KCDC plans to integrate environmental stewardship into all aspects of our 
                    training programs. We are focused on building a community that can stand strong in the face of adversity, and that can 
                    become a beacon of hope for others.
